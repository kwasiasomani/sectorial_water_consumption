## 💡 Why This Project Exists

Every dollar we spend  on food, energy, services, and infrastructure ,quietly pulls water from rivers, aquifers, and ecosystems. Much of this water use is **hidden**, flowing through supply chains long before a product reaches us.

The **Water Multipliers Explorer** makes this invisible water visible.

By combining **economic data** with **river basin geometry**, this project reveals how economic demand translates into **real pressure on Southern California’s water systems**.

## 💧 What Are Water Multipliers?

**Water multipliers** quantify:

> **The total volume of water (m³) required across the entire economy for each dollar of final demand in a given sector.**

This includes:
- 🚜 **Direct water use** — irrigation, manufacturing, extraction  
- 🔄 **Indirect water use** — energy production, material inputs, services  

In other words, water multipliers capture the **true water footprint** of economic activity — not just what is immediately visible.

## 🗺️ Why Focus on Southern California River Basins?

Southern California is one of the most water-stressed regions in North America. It faces:

- 🌵 Chronic scarcity and overdrafted systems  
- 📈 High population density and economic intensity  
- 🌎 Increasing climate variability and drought risk  

River basins provide a powerful lens because they:
- Reflect natural hydrological boundaries  
- Integrate human, ecological, and economic processes  
- Reveal **where economic activity intersects with environmental limits**

This project shows how **economic choices ripple through river basins**, shaping sustainability outcomes far beyond individual sectors.

## 🧭 What This Explorer Lets You Do

With this interactive tool, you can:

- 🌊 Explore how water demand varies across river basins  
- 📊 Compare the water intensity of economic activity  
- 🔍 Understand indirect water dependencies embedded in consumption  
- 🧠 Build intuition about trade-offs between growth and sustainability  

The interface is designed to be **intuitive, exploratory, and educational**, supporting both technical analysis and public understanding.

## 🛠️ Built With

- 🎨 **p5.js** for dynamic, interactive visualization  
- 🌐 Web-based delivery for broad accessibility  
- 🧩 Modular design supporting future expansion  

---

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Water scarcity is not just a hydrological problem — it is an **economic and spatial problem**.

Understanding water multipliers helps decision-makers ask better questions:
- Which sectors exert the greatest hidden pressure on water systems?
- How does consumer demand reshape river basin sustainability?
- Where can policy or efficiency improvements have the greatest impact?

## 🚀 Future Directions

- 📈 Temporal analysis to track change over time  
- 🧩 Expanded sectoral detail  
- 🌍 Application to additional regions and river basins  
- 📊 Integration with climate and land-use scenarios
